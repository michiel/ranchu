# ranchu

ranchu is a command-line tool for developing Mendix JavaScript Custom widgets.
It builds on nodejs, npm and many supporting libraries (see package.json and CREDITS).

At the moment it isn't even ALPHA and very much under development.

It is named after a Japanese goldfish http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranchu
because Mendix has the goldfish as its mascot.
